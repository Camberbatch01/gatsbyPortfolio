      <p>Hey! I'm Cameron, a graduate in Mathematics, looking to get into web development.</p><br></br>
      <p>I was introduced to programming when I was 16 in college, where I was taught visual basic. I did decide to do mathematics at university though as its a broader area and allowed me more career options, including programming.</p><br></br>
      <p>During university, I did some programming in R, Matlab etc. Mainly mathematical based languages, so you could say I haven't stopped programming since I was 16, however not in depth.</p><br></br>
      <p>After university, I decided I wanted a career as a developer and started learning in depth. My main areas of expertise are JS and React, although I have experience in projects using other technologies, such as node.js</p>
